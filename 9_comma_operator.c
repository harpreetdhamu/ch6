/*
A comma expression has the 
c om m a e x p r e s s io n exp r l , expr2
where exprl and expr2 are any two expressions. A comma expression is evaluated
in two steps: First, exprl is evaluated and its value discarded. Second, expr2 is
evaluated; its value is the value of the entire expression. Evaluating exprl should
always have a side effect; if it doesnâ€™t, then exprl serves no purpose.
Comma Operator - Associativity - left to right
Precedence - lower than all other operators
